# Welcome to pomodoro-deluxe

Idea for this project comes from przeprogramowani.pl javascript course.

## App is not 100% ready yet !

There are still many tasty features to come:
1. Better timer with service worker support
2. Nicer table in History component
3. Imidiate switch to current session on task creation
4. Local storage
5. and more!

## Errors to be fixed
1. GitHub pages routing 404 problem on page refresh (sacrifice for working routing animations for now - HashRouter does not support location.key property, which is necessary for animations to work)

## Tools
- create-react-app
- react-modal
- react-router
- react-transition-group
- react-csv

- CSS + SASS
- BEM
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
